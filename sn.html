                            <p>I have always been passionate about teamwork,leadership,and community service. 
                                As an active member of Scouts and Guides during my school years, I developed essential skills in discipline and teamwork
                                At the HSS level, as an NSS volunteer,I actively engaged in community development programs</p>

                            <p>As part of a Resource Exchange Program between Christ College and Mary Matha College, Wayanad, I, along with 40 peers, had the opportunity to visit Mary Matha College for a two-day training on Basic Flutter and Canva.
                                 This program allowed us to gain hands-on experience in mobile app development using Flutter and creative design with Canva.
