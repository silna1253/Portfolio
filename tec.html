                <h1>Zephyrus â€“ Annual Tech Fest</h1>
                <p>
                    As a BCA student in the Computer Science department, I actively participated and coordinated events in Zephyrus, our department's annual tech fest. 
                                Organized by students and faculties, this fest brings together participants from various colleges and features exciting events such as AR treasure hunts, expos, quizzes, fashion shows, ideathons, and more.

                                My role as an event coordinator allowed me to enhance my leadership, teamwork, and organizational skills, contributing to the smooth execution of multiple activities. Through this experience, I gained valuable exposure in managing large-scale events and collaborating with peers from diverse backgrounds
