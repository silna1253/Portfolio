                    As part of a Resource Exchange Program between Christ College, Irinjalakuda, Thrissur, and Mary Matha College, Mananthavady, Wayanad, 
                    I, along with 40 peers, had the opportunity to attend a two-day training on Flutter and Canva at Mary Matha College.

                <h1>Basic Flutter & Canva Training</h1>
                <p>
                    In the Flutter session, I learned the basic concepts of Flutter and gained an understanding of mobile app development. 
                    In the Canva session, I explored poster design techniques and worked on a hands-on task to create a poster.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This program not only enhanced my technical and creative skills but also provided the experience of learning in a new academic environment while collaborating with students from another institution.
