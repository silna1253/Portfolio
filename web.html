                <h1>Web Designing</h1>
                <p>
                    I specialize in frontend web designing, creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                     My designs focus on clean layouts, smooth navigation, and interactive elements, ensuring an engaging user experience across all devices.
                     <br>
                     While my primary expertise lies in frontend development, I also work on backend functionalities when needed, integrating server-side logic to enhance website performance and functionality. 
                     This blend of frontend creativity and backend logic enables me to develop well-rounded web solutions.

                    Bloomyard focuses on delivering personalized and handcrafted products, making gifting more special and meaningful. Through this project, 
                    I enhanced my skills in web designing, frontend development, and e-commerce functionality, ensuring a smooth and engaging online shopping experience.
