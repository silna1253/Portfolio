                    I am passionate about teaching and enjoy making learning an engaging and enriching experience for students of all levels. 
                    I take tuition classes for LP (Lower Primary) students, focusing on building strong foundational skills in various subjects.
                    <br>
                    My teaching approach emphasizes clear explanations, and interactive learning ensuring students grasp concepts effectively. 
                    I strive to create a supportive and encouraging environment where students can learn at their own pace and develop confidence in their skills.
