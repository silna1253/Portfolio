                <h1>Volunteer</h1>
                <p>I have always been passionate about teamwork, leadership, and community service. 
                    <br>
                    As an active member of Scouts and Guides during my school years,

                    <br>
                    At the HSS level, as an NSS volunteer, I actively engaged in community development programs, social awareness campaigns, and service-oriented initiatives. 
                    Through these experiences, I strengthened my ability to work in teams, lead projects, and contribute meaningfully to society.
                    These roles have shaped my commitment to responsibility, collaboration, and making a positive impact—values that I carry forward in both my professional and personal endeavors.
